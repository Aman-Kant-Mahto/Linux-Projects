# 🐧 Task 8: Understanding Interrupt Signals (`Ctrl+C` & `Ctrl+Z`) in Linux

📖 This task explores what happens behind the scenes when we use **`Ctrl+C`** and **`Ctrl+Z`** in the Linux terminal.  
These key combinations send **signals** to processes, helping users control program execution.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- `Ctrl+C` → Sends the **SIGINT (Interrupt Signal)** to terminate a process.
- `Ctrl+Z` → Sends the **SIGTSTP (Terminal Stop Signal)** to pause (suspend) a process.
- Resuming suspended processes using `fg` (foreground) or `bg` (background).
- Learned how Linux uses **signals** for process management.
